## 10-20 Electrode Placement System

The 10-20 system is a widely used method in electroencephalography (EEG) for placing electrodes on the scalp. It is designed to provide standardized and reproducible locations, with electrode positions based on the relationship to the skull size. The system's name refers to the fact that the distances between adjacent electrodes are either 10% or 20% of the total front-to-back or right-to-left measurement of the head. This system ensures consistent and accurate data collection across different individuals and studies.

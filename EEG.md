## 10-20 Electrode Placement System

The 10-20 system is a widely used method in electroencephalography (EEG) for placing electrodes on the scalp. It is designed to provide standardized and reproducible locations, with electrode positions based on the relationship to the skull size. The system's name refers to the fact that the distances between adjacent electrodes are either 10% or 20% of the total front-to-back or right-to-left measurement of the head. This system ensures consistent and accurate data collection across different individuals and studies.

## P300 speller

A **P300 speller** is a brain-computer interface (BCI) system that enables communication for individuals with severe motor impairments, such as those with locked-in syndrome. It is based on the P300 event-related potential (ERP), a measurable brainwave that occurs approximately 300 milliseconds after a person recognizes a stimulus (hence the name "P300").

how it typically works:

1. **Grid Display**: The user is presented with a grid of letters or symbols on a screen, and the rows and columns of the grid flash in random order.
   
2. **Target Recognition**: The user is asked to focus on the character they want to select, and when the row or column containing that character flashes, it triggers a P300 response in their brain.

3. **Signal Detection**: Electroencephalography (EEG) sensors record brain signals. The system detects the P300 signal corresponding to the flashed row or column, and after several repetitions, it identifies the desired character.

4. **Character Selection**: Based on the detected P300 responses, the system selects and displays the character the user is focusing on.
